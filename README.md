One-dimensional off-lattice system of self-propelled particles.

Particles follow Brownian Dynamics with self propulsion.

Particle interactions are given by a Lennard-Jones potential.

The system has Periodic Boundary Conditions.

Particles can also have explicit collective dynamics: moving clusters.
